# Eric Tao Senior Project Schmidt Lab

This is a repository for storing the code used for my senior project (Fall 2024 and Spring 2025) analyzing how male cowbirds vary their song in different social circumstances.

I started by performing a UMAP visualization of the 54 female-directed songs and 43 male-directed songs segmented by my co-investigator Christina. This code is found in `umap.ipynb`.
